          Senior year of high school, I had an opportunity to take classes at Red Rocks Community 
          College. Wanting to get a jump on my college education, I happily took the opportunity. 
          I was well aware that I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. I loved writing, 
          I loved my math classes, history was fascinating, but I really did not know what I wanted 
          to do. So, I stayed at Red Rocks and got my Associate of Science degree. Thankfully, in 
          my last semester, I took an intro to Computer Programming course. The rest is history!

        I graduated in 2020 with a BA in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. 
        Go Buffs!! A BA, not a BS, you ask? That is correct! When I attended CU, they offered a BA 
        to computer science students. The BA allowed students to take all of the same classes as 
        the BS students if they chose, but allowed their electives to be more based in the arts. 
        As someone who loves writing and art, I chose the BA option. This allowed me to explore 
        classes such as environmental biology, a graphic novel class, and several history and 
        anthropology courses all while diving into classes such as Object-Oriented Programming, 
        Algorithms, and Data Science.
